## Description:
What the TECH is a tech blog that allows user to create posts sharing links they found useful or interesting. They can also commment and vote on posts by other users.



## Technologies
The Express.js framework was used for the API. The Sequelize ORM was used to ease the communication between the javascript app logic and the sql database querying (mysql2). Dotenv was used to protect login info on Github. The application is deployed on heroku. JAWSDB was used to allow mysql usage with heroku. Handlebars was used for the templating engine. Express-sessions facilitated the login functionality.



## Deployment:
The app is deployed on [Heroku](https://tech-heckler.herokuapp.com/)




## Usage
