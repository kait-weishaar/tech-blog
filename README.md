## Description:
What the TECH is a tech blog that allows user to create posts sharing links they found useful or interesting. They can also commment and vote on posts by other users.



## Technologies
The Express.js framework was used for the API. The Sequelize ORM was used to ease the communication between the javascript app logic and the sql database querying (mysql2). Dotenv was used to protect login info on Github. The application is deployed on heroku. JAWSDB was used to allow mysql usage with heroku. Handlebars was used for the templating engine. Express-sessions facilitated the login functionality.



## Deployment:
The app is deployed on [Heroku](https://tech-heckler.herokuapp.com/)




## Usage
A user must create an account to post content to the site. After signing up and logging in, the user can create a new post, edit their post, and comment and vote on posts by other users. From their dashbooard, a user can see their posts and create a new post.

## Future Development
Implementing a front-end would be a good exercise to improve my full-stack capabilities and reinforce how the moodel (data) layer is manipulated by the controller to change the view (MVC). Currently there is really no view to complete the MVC paradigm.
